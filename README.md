# Aloha Website

The Aloha website is the first project you are required to complete at Red Academy. It is a simple yet functional single pages site that contains: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Elements. The purpose of this exercise is to teach the fundamentals of front-end web design.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Custom Fonts, ICO Fonts, Flexbox, and Flickity.

### Personal Learnings

When starting this project I had effectively zero, recent, practical experience writing code.
As of the completion of this project I feel confident in my ability to:
    build the "bones" of a site in HTML.
    Utilize appropriate tab spacing (not spacebar spacing sorry <3 )
    Organize my ROOT directory efficiently
    Maintain my files using a git repository and github
    Utilize console commands to an acceptable proficiency
    Understand the "box model" and how to use flexbox to take advantage of it
    add visual complexities to the elements added in HTML using CSS.
    Generate and initialize content using Javascript.
    Add custom Fonts either locally or linked on-line.
    Add icon fonts to a website.
    Install and utilize the plugins, such as Flickity.
    Code basic - moderate javascript to effect my website in a dynamic way.
    understand the logic of responsive design, as well as the benefit of designing "mobile first".
    understand and appreciate the value of co-operation and teamwork between my fellow students.
    understand and appreciate the value of my instructors and the knowledge I have at my disposal.
    Effectively research solutions to common (and not so common) issues.
    And actually a lot more as well.
